\section{Introduction}
\par
\indent 
Interstellar space is occupied by gigantic clouds of gas, dust and cosmic rays. Gas clouds are composed of different phases dependent on the nature of the matter - ionic, molecular or atomic. They are studied to understand specific local dynamics of star formation, which gives insights into a galaxy's stellar life cycle[1]. Interstellar molecular gas clouds are studied through spectroscopic analysis of molecular transition frequencies, which allows physical and chemical reactions in the cloud to be analysed. Radio telescopes are used to scan interstellar gas clouds at frequencies that are characteristic of certain molecules' spectra[2], establishing observational data about their velocity and vibrational states[3].

\par
The most common elements found in interstellar gas clouds are hydrogen, followed by helium, with trace amounts of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. Hydrogen and helium are mostly present due to primordial nucleosynthesis while heavier elements are formed during stellar life cycles, in stellar cores or in supernovae.[1] Unexpectedly, the chemical reaction rate in these clouds, which was thought to be extremely slow due to the low density and temperature, was observationally found to be much higher than expected, as organic molecules such as formaldehyde and vinyl alcohol were found in much larger quantities than was thought possible. This indicated the existence of gas-phase reactions unknown to Earth-based organic chemistry.[4] Heavier elements, mostly metals, are also studied quantitatively. Their presence and existence in compounds is used to develop new theories of metal formation, especially when their ratios are inexplicable through fusion alone.[4]

\par
The NIST Standard Reference Database presents a tabulation of every molecule thus discovered and stores them in order of empirical formula, along with relevant isotopic species, their reference number and the telescope(s) used for gathering raw data. A total of 151 species have thus been discovered[5], of which 134 have been identified by means of their microwave spectra[6] and 17 by means of infrared or ultraviolet spectra, alongside 8 additional species only found in comets.[7] In these tables, recent research papers detailing advanced astronomical studies of these specific molecules can be found. Having been studied for over a century, this database is a way for the relevant astronomical and astrophysical literature to be collected and updates as and when new papers are written. The present work is to provide accurate information on the rest frequencies and transition frequencies of each of the aforementioned molecular species[8].

\section{Methodology}

\par\indent
The objective of this project was to compile some interesting and relevant data from this database into one place. Since this database consists of an advanced search function, which requires data, and a series of linked research papers, the actual data given by these papers is fairly inaccessible if required in large quantities. Since it is impossible to consolidate more than 150 research papers' worth of data in one place, we selected the following categories of information given in the majority of these academic reviews: place of research, transition frequencies observed, telescope(s) used to collect data, marked similarities to other molecular species, and interesting or uncommon points noted about the molecule in the study.

\par
As a majority of the papers in the database were available in PDF format or in HTML online, we considered employing a web-scraping LLM model to compile every single paper before sorting to get the data we needed. However, no single method would work for most of the papers, some of which were paywalled, some in foreign languages, and some simply unavailable to us. Considering our relative inexpertise in coding, the required data was simply retrieved manually.

\par
Alongside compiling the data for the species in the database, a scatter-plot has been made to show the transition frequencies of these species in comparison to each other, as well as the temperature of the surroundings, which is important information for the chemical reactions that determine the gas cloud's composition and stability.

\par
Here, we find that most of the studies took place in Orion A, Sagittarius B, the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 or the envelope of the infrared star IRC +10216, which has been used for circumstellar studies[8]. Applicable radio telescopes are attached in a table to the database[9].

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the research project represents a comprehensive compilation and analysis of data extracted from numerous research papers focused on the observation of molecular transitions within interstellar space. The primary objective was to consolidate valuable information from the NIST Standard Reference Database, focusing on the intricate dynamics of interstellar molecular gas clouds and species embedded within them.

Through thorough examination, it is evident that the study of interstellar molecular gas clouds is a sophisticated field that significantly contributes to our understanding of astrophysical processes. The use of radio telescopes to conduct spectroscopic analyses has enabled researchers to study the various phases of gas clouds, including ionic, molecular, and atomic compositions.

A noteworthy revelation in this study is the unexpected prevalence of organic molecules, such as formaldehyde and vinyl alcohol, challenging preconceived notions about the chemical reactivity within these low-density and low-temperature environments. This discovery underscores the existence of gas-phase reactions not previously recognized by terrestrial organic chemistry.

The database, precisely curated from over a large data obtained from research, contains a rich repository of 151 molecular species, offering insights into the chemical makeup of interstellar gas clouds. Hydrogen and helium, products of primordial coalescence's, dominate, while heavier elements, especially metals, provide crucial information for developing theories on their formation, particularly when fusion alone cannot account for their observed ratios.

The tables presented in this report showcases the transition frequencies of various molecular species, providing an understanding of their properties. The selected locations for studies, including Orion A, Sagittarius B, Taurus Molecular Cloud 1, and the envelope of the infrared star IRC +10216, demonstrate the significance of these regions in advancing our knowledge of interstellar molecular composition.

In essence, this project contributes to the ongoing dialogue in the astronomical and astrophysical community by providing accessible source of information. The concised data and analyses shown here serves a valuable resource for researchers, allowing for exploration and refinement of understanding the molecular intricacies within interstellar space. As the field progresses, this compilation will remain an essential reference, thriving the continued advancements in the study of vast and enigmatic universe.
